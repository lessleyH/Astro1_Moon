Here, we see the Earth, Moon, & Sun from a bird's eye view.
What's neat is the sizes and distance btwn the Earth & Moon are roughly to scale!
Technically, the Sun wouldn't fit on our screen at this scale... 
...so I've drawn it a LOT closer to the Earth, so it's easier to see :)
See how the Moon travels counterclockwise around the Earth?
It even seems to change phases as it orbits the Earth.
Half of the Moon faces the Sun, while the other half faces away.
But how does this look from Earth?
(1) "New Moon" happens when the Moon is in the same direction in the sky as the Sun.
...it looks dark because the side we see isn't getting sunlight.
(2) "Waxing Crescent" appears a couple days later...
...what we see is sunlight that the Moon is starting to reflect towards us!
...by the way, waxing just means "growing."
(3) "First Quarter" is when we can see half of the Moon's lit side.
(4) "Waxing Gibbous" shows us more of the Moon's lit side...
...did you know "gibbous" means growing?
(5) "Full Moon" happens when the Moon is directly opposite the Sun in the sky...
...showing us its entire illuminated side, a beautiful sight to see...
...you might be thinking, why doesn't Earth block sunlight from reaching the Moon!?...
...it's because the Earth orbits the Sun on a different plane (or "surface")...
...than the Moon actually orbits the Earth!
(6) "Waning Gibbous" begins our return journey towards the "New Moon" phase.
(7) "Third Quarter" continues our reverse order. We see half of the Moon's lit side.
(8) "Waning Crescent" is our final glimpse at the Moon until...
(1) "New Moon" is back! The lunar phases now repeat.
