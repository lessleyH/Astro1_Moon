(1) Poles
At the lunar poles, specifically in their shadowed craters, there is water ice!
NASA confirmed this in 2009, when it crashed a satellite into the Cabeus crater near the South pole.
The impact released what appeared to be water vapor high above the surface!
Water ice is probably the remains of asteroids and comets that collided w/ the Moon.
The ice never melted because of how little sunlight the lunar poles recieve.
