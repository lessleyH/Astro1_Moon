Earth suffered many impacts 
Roughly 50 million years when things seemed to settled down 
*Theia Impact
A mars sized planet name Theia slammed into our young planet 
The impact of Theia’s grazing collision on the Earth was colossal 
*Theia Graze
Blasting a huge amount of material from both planets into space 
Most of the objects came from the outer layers of the earth 
*Our Moon
This material rapidly coalesced into the moon 
That is the giant impact hypothesis!
