The origin of the Moon remains mysterious, 
but since astronauts walked on the Moon in 1969 and brought back rock and soil samples, 
we know more about it now than before.
The most prominent idea for how the moon formed is the GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS
4.6 billion years ago when the solar system formed there were a lot more objects orbiting the sun than now
That meant that there were lots of collisions and no doubt Earth suffered many impacts 
A mars sized(about one-tenth the size of Earth) planet name Theia slammed into our young planet 
The impact of Theiaâ€™s was a grazing collision on the Earth was colossal 
Blasting a huge amount of material from both planets into space 
Some of the material from the impact was absorbed into the liquefied Earth 
But some material ricocheted into space, where it settled into orbit and coalesced as the Moon
At first the Moon orbited much closer to Earth  
It is still moving away at a rate of almost two inches (four centimeters) per year.
The Moon significantly affects conditions on Earth. 
The impact that produced the Moon tilted Earth on its axis.
